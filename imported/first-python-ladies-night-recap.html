<p>On April 16, 2011, a group of 5 local female Python developers got together for the first ever Python ladies' night. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We had wine, sparkling elderflower and ginger waters,&nbsp;vegetable spaghetti, savory meat pies from Porto's bakery, Caesar salad, homemade garlic bread, tea, and tiramisu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python women's advocacy (mostly!)</li>
<li>virtualenv</li>
<li>the mod_wsgi documentation</li>
<li>Django-based content management systems</li>
<li>how we each got into Python development</li>
</ul>
<p>And we started plans for a women's Python workshop on May 15, 2011. &nbsp;Details about how to get tickets will be announced this week.</p>
<p>It was an exciting meeting with a lot of positive energy. &nbsp;Everyone present was passionate about Python women's advocacy and wanted to help increase diversity in the local Python community. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end, we went up to the rooftop lounge, where we had a spectacular view of downtown LA. &nbsp;Some of us relaxed in the jacuzzi, while others hung out and chatted poolside.</p>
<p>Our next ladies' night is scheduled for May 6, 2011. &nbsp;If you'd like to come and get involved, please contact me at audreyr@cartwheelweb.com for more details.</p>
