<p>What a blast I had on Saturday!  It was a great learning experience for both the attendees and for us PyLadies org board!  Good lessons learned, such as virtualenv is a beast to install depending on one’s operating system.  Next time, we’ll have a pre-workshop session for installation of dependencies and such.</p>
<p>We went through how to build a blog using Django and its class-based views.  We also went over Model-View-Controller concepts, and how they apply to Django.  We wrapped up with a quick overview of how easy it is to deploy an application on Heroku (way too easy!).</p>
<p>I’ve made a <a href="https://github.com/econchick/PyLadiesBYOBlog" _mce_href="https://github.com/econchick/PyLadiesBYOBlog">GitHub repo</a> for people to fork &amp; contribute.  I didn’t find an easily accessible tutorial for building a blog, or for building a simple app using Django’s class views, so hopefully this will grow to something useful in the Django community.
Til next time!</p>
