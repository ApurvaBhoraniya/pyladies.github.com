<p>If you were at DjangoCon you probably saw people wearing these, standing out magnificently amongst the sea of bright green. They were the cool people -- the Djangstas, if you will. <br /></p><p>We were originally going to sell these only  at DjangoCon, but demand was so high we've decided to do one more print run. If you&nbsp; hesitated the first time around (and are now full of regret), or were shortsighted enough to give DjangoCon a miss altogether this year (and are now SO full of regret), here's your chance to redeem yourself and join the ranks of the Djangstas! </p><p>Shirts will now cost $25, to cover shipping and/or PayPal fees. <br /></p><p><strong>Please pre-order by October 1,</strong> by filling out the form below. We'll email you to confirm so you can pay us (via check or Paypal)&nbsp; before we print and mail you your shirt. <br /></p><hr /><strong>ďťż</strong>
