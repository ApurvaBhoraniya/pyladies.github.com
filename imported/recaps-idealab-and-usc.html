They were impatient to learn about web scraping from kjam, and eager to follow along with the code samples presented at the end-of-day lightning talks.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/amazon.png" _mce_src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/amazon.png" /><br /></p><p>Photos from this event are up on our <a _mce_href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/sets/72157628083649345/" href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/sets/72157628083649345/">Flickr page</a>!&nbsp; BIG thanks to Geneva Oh of USC Annenberg and Prof. <strong>Robert Hernandez </strong>for proposing, organizing and promoting this workshop for USC students and journalists (including one intrepid nerd-to-be who flew in from Arizona solely for this event!), as well as sponsoring the venue and food. </p><p>Lightning talks from</p><p><strong>xtine</strong>: scraping data from a music website for fun!</p><p><strong>Michael</strong>: Why Documentation Matters</p><p><strong>Robin</strong>: <a _mce_href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/ListComps.ppt" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/ListComps.ppt">Python List Comprensions</a> [.ppt]</p><p><strong>Emma</strong>: "<a _mce_href="http://djangolookslikefun.wordpress.com/2011/10/22/lightning-talk-hello-world/" href="http://djangolookslikefun.wordpress.com/2011/10/22/lightning-talk-hello-world/">Hello world!</a>" (an encore by popular demand)</p><p><strong>Leo</strong>: I can't remember at the moment but I'm sure it was fabulous!<br /></p><p><a _mce_href="http://cars.com" href="http://cars.com">Cars.com</a> generously hosted a post-workshop PyLadies social hour, plying us with beer and delicious appetizers from the campus bar.
