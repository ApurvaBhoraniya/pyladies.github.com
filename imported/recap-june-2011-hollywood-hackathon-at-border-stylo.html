<p>Last  Saturday we held our first hackathon of the summer at the offices of  <a href="http://borderstylo.com" _mce_href="http://borderstylo.com" style="" _mce_style="">Border Stylo</a> in Hollywood, in partnership with the <a href="http://socal-piggies.org" _mce_href="http://socal-piggies.org" style="" _mce_style="">SoCal Python Interest  Group</a> (“SoCal Piggies”). We invited not only newcomers to Python  programming, like those who attended the <a href="/blog/intro-to-python-workshop-recap/" _mce_href="/blog/intro-to-python-workshop-recap/" style="" _mce_style="">May Beginner’s Workshop,</a> but  also seasoned developers who came to hack away on their own projects --  and who happily volunteered themselves to be mentors to those  aforementioned n00bs. </p><p>Roughly 60% of the day’s 55 in-person participants and 90% of the 30 remote participants were female,  well beyond the PyLadies’ goal of having a 1:1 male-female ratio at  Pythonista events. &nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; " _mce_style="font-weight: bold;">OSS Bounty</span></p><p>A  few days before the hackathon, Audrey <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/pyladies/status/81081811853258752" _mce_href="https://twitter.com/#!/pyladies/status/81081811853258752" style="" _mce_style="">put out the call</a> for hackers to  contribute to open source projects, offering these freshly printed  PyLadies shirts as a reward for anyone who committed code to a FOSS  project (Audrey's wearing the new one!):</p><p>

After traveling  all that way, it’s no surprise that they opted for the comfy couches:</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/5851379185/" _mce_href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/5851379185/" title="The Future of Python by pydanny, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5157/5851379185_1f82df2c51_m.jpg" _mce_src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5157/5851379185_1f82df2c51_m.jpg" alt="The Future of Python" height="180" width="240" /></a><br _mce_bogus="1" /></p><p>Even  people who couldn’t attend the hackathon in person, citing lame excuses  such as not being located in California, were nevertheless invited to  join in the fun -- Audrey will be shipping free shirts to everyone who participated remotely and&nbsp;contributed to open-source, including one PyLady who committed code from across the Atlantic:</p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/asendecka" _mce_href="http://twitter.com/asendecka" style="" _mce_style=""><img src="http://style.esthernam.com/pyladies/images/poland.png" _mce_src="http://style.esthernam.com/pyladies/images/poland.png" title="poland pylady!" /></a></p><p>What time was it in Poland???</p><p>During  the hackathon we threw the #pyladies IRC chatroom up on the big screen  so people could follow online discussions no matter where they were  sitting -- without straining their thumbs from alt-tabbing. (PS If you want to join us on IRC anytime, we are in #pyladies on freenode.net!)</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5865614874/" _mce_href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5865614874/" title="IMG_1649.JPG by PyLadies, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2720/5865614874_48f47f16e8_m.jpg" _mce_src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2720/5865614874_48f47f16e8_m.jpg" alt="IMG_1649.JPG" height="240" width="179" /></a><br _mce_bogus="1" /></p><h4><br /></h4><h4>The Future of Python</h4><p>After 4 hours of intensive hacking, it was time to take a break! Audrey herded us outside  for a group photo. As PyDanny notes, it's a glimpse of the Python  community of the future:<br /></p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5851383215/" _mce_href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5851383215/" title="IMG_2468a.jpg by PyLadies, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5851383215_1b5368d3a5.jpg" _mce_src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5851383215_1b5368d3a5.jpg" alt="IMG_2468a.jpg" height="300" width="400" /></a><br _mce_bogus="1" /></p><p>Pretty grand!</p><p><br /></p><h4>After Dark</h4><p>Though the Hollywood sky was outside was warm and bright, we soon drifted back indoors to chow down on Crispy Crust pizza and wings while listening to the  end-of-day lightning talks:</p><ul><li>Dirk gave a demo of his <a href="http://opani.com" _mce_href="http://opani.com" style="" _mce_style="">Opani</a> platform, which leverages the cloud for social supercomputing.<br /></li><li>Michael introduced the <a href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/dev/" _mce_href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/dev/" style="" _mce_style="">Pyramid</a> web framework and <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" _mce_href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" style="" _mce_style="">Jenkins CI</a>.<br /></li><li>Sandy shared some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg0Rvj-Seto" _mce_href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg0Rvj-Seto" style="" _mce_style="">amazing</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDqYWsl39Ro" _mce_href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDqYWsl39Ro" style="" _mce_style="">demos</a> of <a href="http://openkinect.org/wiki/Python_Wrapper" _mce_href="http://openkinect.org/wiki/Python_Wrapper" style="" _mce_style="">Python</a>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect" _mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect" style="" _mce_style="">Xbox Kinect</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYq9gkdpiS8" _mce_href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYq9gkdpiS8" style="" _mce_style="">hacking</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/jacobburch" _mce_href="http://twitter.com/jacobburch" style="" _mce_style="">Jacob</a> gave a PEP8 talk on best practices<br /></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/jeffschenck" _mce_href="https://twitter.com/#!/jeffschenck" style="" _mce_style="">Jeff</a> admonished us to leave no Windows developers behind<br /></li><li>Katharine and Danny proffered some <a href="http://kjamistan.tumblr.com/post/6675268237/on-becoming-a-fabulous-pythonista" _mce_href="http://kjamistan.tumblr.com/post/6675268237/on-becoming-a-fabulous-pythonista" style="" _mce_style="">words</a> of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer" _mce_href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer" style="" _mce_style="">encouragement</a> for developers of all skill levels.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5851386011/" _mce_href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5851386011/" title="IMG_2518a.jpg by PyLadies, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5150/5851386011_d1b34c2c3e_m.jpg" _mce_src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5150/5851386011_d1b34c2c3e_m.jpg" alt="IMG_2518a.jpg" height="180" width="240" /></a><br _mce_bogus="1" /></p><p>After  the lightning talks, it was time to clean up, load out, and head over  to the Melgard Public House for some well-earned beer and socializing  time! &nbsp;This part was originally supposed to be Python Ladies’ Night 4,  but once we found that the PyDudes weren’t so bad to hang out with, &nbsp;we  gladly invited them along. &nbsp;Fun was had by all!</p><p><br /></p><h4>Big Thank-Yous</h4><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5851937660/" _mce_href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5851937660/" title="IMG_2529.JPG by PyLadies, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5144/5851937660_1acdbb5648_m.jpg" _mce_src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5144/5851937660_1acdbb5648_m.jpg" alt="IMG_2529.JPG" height="180" width="240" /></a><br _mce_bogus="1" /></p><p>Gabriel, who played the part of event host on behalf of <a href="http://www.borderstylo.com" _mce_href="http://www.borderstylo.com" style="" _mce_style="">Border Stylo</a>, said that  of all the events his company has held (which is a lot!), ours was by  far the smoothest and most awesome. &nbsp;Hope this means you’ll have us back, Gabe!</p><p>We of course have to thank the <a href="http://www.python.org/psf/" _mce_href="http://www.python.org/psf/" style="" _mce_style="">Python Software Foundation</a> for giving us <a href="/blog/thank-you-python-software-foundation/" _mce_href="/blog/thank-you-python-software-foundation/" style="" _mce_style="">two</a> <a href="http://pythonsprints.com" _mce_href="http://pythonsprints.com" style="" _mce_style="">grants</a> to support this hackathon. &nbsp;Thanks to them, we were able to purchase enough tables and chairs to keep 55 hackers coding happily away in the same room, which led to much mingling and mentoring. &nbsp;They also helped foot the bill for drinks, snacks and dinner, so that we could fortify our hardworking brains with glucose-heavy treats and sodas all day long. And let's not forget the wonderful T-shirts for open source contributors!<br /></p><p><br /></p><h4>Coming up....</h4><p>We  really want to keep the momentum going for opening up the Python  community to people of all stripes, and to provide a non-threatening  environment where everyone feels welcome to work on their projects and learn to become a better developer without having to worry about whether  they fit in or feeling stupid for trying.

</p><p>To that end, we’ve  got at least <a href="/events" _mce_href="/events" style="" _mce_style="">a few more hackathons and other cool outings</a> in the works, so  don’t forget to sign up for our mailing list, and <a href="http://twitter.com/pyladies" _mce_href="http://twitter.com/pyladies" style="" _mce_style="">follow us on Twitter</a>&nbsp;so you'll be the first to know when and where and what the PyLadies will be doing next! Thanks to all who attended, whether virtually or in-person -- and sorry to those on the waitlist who couldn't: we hope you'll catch us earlier next time, or connect with us online! <br /></p>
