        <p>On Sunday, May 15, 2011, the PyLadies held an Intro to Python workshop
at KPCC's Crawford Family Forum in Pasadena.</p>
<p>The goal was to create a safe, comfortable space for women to learn
Python programming and be able to ask questions openly.  Men were
welcome as volunteers or as the +1 guests of women.</p>
<p>It was clear that this was a gathering of educated, sharp, successful
women.  Our <strong>female</strong> attendees included:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Grad students from UCLA and CalTech, and over-educated women with
multiple degrees and Ph.Ds.</li>
<li>Senior marketers and community managers with over 10,000 Twitter
followers, working on prominent tech projects</li>
<li>UX (user experience) professionals working for top companies</li>
<li>Research scientists currently using other languages in their labs for
numerical analysis</li>
<li>Co-founders of startups, with 1 or more funded and/or successful
companies under their belt</li>
<li>Experienced software engineers with Java, C++, .NET, PHP backgrounds</li>
<li>Product managers at top companies</li>
<li>Talented Linux sysadmins</li>
<li>Hardware hackers involved with the various LA area hackerspaces</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on and on.  Many were happily employed, but some were looking
for technical jobs.  I'm hoping some of the job seekers apply to work at
KPCC, our venue sponsor!</p>
<p>In the morning, Katharine and I did a walkthrough of the popular <a class="reference external" href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org">Learn
Python the Hard Way</a> tutorial by Zed
Shaw.  Attendees typed along with each exercise.  At the end of each
exercise, we reviewed the new concepts covered.</p>
<p>During lunch, KPCC's senior web producer Jason Georges took everyone on
a tour behind the scenes of the radio station.  KPCC is full of cool
things like soundproof glass cube recording rooms.</p>
<p>Then we were greeted by former NFL player and pastry chef George
Wrighster with a surprise tray of cupcakes from his bakery, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.violetscakes.com/">Violet's
Cakes</a>.  Yummy!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we split up into smaller breakout sessions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>craping the Web with Python, or How I Automatically Get Happy Hour Specials Delivered to my Inbox</li>
<li>Intro to Django with the Django Poll Tutorial</li>
<li>Learn Python The Hard Way, Part 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the PyLadies volunteer organizers gave lightning talks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Equality: Equivalence in Python by <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/tiny_mouse">Jess Stanton</a></li>
<li>Project Euler Demo by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xtine.net/">Christine Cheung</a></li>
<li>Python Web Frameworks by <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/kjam">Katharine Jarmul</a></li>
<li>Generators by <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/sandymahalo">Sandy Strong</a></li>
<li>Ergonomics by <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/estherbester">Esther Nam</a></li>
<li>The Code Behind PyLadies.com by <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/audreyr">Audrey Roy</a></li>
<li>Inequality: Stories from the Python &amp; Developer Communities by <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/tiny_mouse">Jess Stanton</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end, we celebrated over root beer floats.  It was interesting and
exciting to see that no one wanted to leave at the end!  I was thrilled
and floating on a cloud, and so were all the other organizers and
volunteers.</p>
<p>Thank you to our special out-of-town guests!  If there's anything we can
do to help you in any way with your local women's developer communities,
let us know.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/thisgirlangie">Angie Chang</a>, co-founder of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.women2.org/">Women 2.0</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bayareagirlgeekdinners.com/">Bay Area Girl Geek dinners</a> &amp; product manager at Zinch from SF, who flew into LA just for our event</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/heatherpayne">Heather Payne</a>, senior marketing coordinator for a global staffing/HR firm from Toronto, who flew home <a class="reference external" href="http://heatherpayne.ca/review-of-pyladies-intro-to-python-workshop">eager to start a local women's Python coding group</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations to all 25 ladies and 2 men who completed our intro
workshop, and special thanks to all the men who attended and volunteered
for braving the crowd of ladies.</p>
