        <p>Last week the PyLadies took Portland, Oregon by storm: after months of
planning, brainstorming, planning, rehearsing, and even a bit of
planning, we flew in <em>en masse</em> to <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.us">DjangoCon
2011</a> for six action-packed days of tutorials,
talks, code sprints, and raucous socializing with Django developers from
all over the world.</p>
<div class="section" id="image0">

</div>
<div class="section" id="tutorials-talks-and-sprints">
<h2>Tutorials, talks, and sprints</h2>
<p>Most of the talks from DjangoCon will be available
<a class="reference external" href="http://blip.tv/djangocon">online</a> soon (we hope!) - lots of slides
and other docs are available via
<a class="reference external" href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/djangocon-us/">Lanyrd</a>. Here's a brief recap
of how the PyLadies represented last week:</p>
<p>On Monday we labored through a pre-conference day of tutorials to help
<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/pydanny">PyDanny</a> lead the Ultimate Django
Tutorial, all proceeds from which went directly to the PyLadies. We had
invaluable assistance from other great mentors like
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/">DSF</a> president <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/freakboy3742">Russell
Keith-Magee</a>&nbsp; and <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/gabrielmgrant">Gabriel
Grant</a> of
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dotcloud.com/">DotCloud</a>, to name just two.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6157/6146290822_7c1bf5c590.jpg" /></p>
<p>The conference began in earnest on Tuesday, with <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/limedaring">Tracy</a> delivering an inspiring <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/limedaring/from-designer-to-djangoer-in-six-weeks-a-story-from-solo-founder">talk</a>&nbsp;about launching her own <a class="reference external" href="http://www.weddinginvitelove.com/">startup</a> in six weeks by teaching herself Django. That afternoon, <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/sandymahalo">Sandy</a> wowed even the most experienced developers in the room with her excellent talk on <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/a/pyladies.com/present/view?id=0AVthC0Z3iw8DZGRrdnFzeGdfN2c5bWJ6d2Y1&amp;hl=en_US">best practices in testing</a>.  <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/audreyr">Audrey</a>&nbsp; and <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/webdevgirl">Christine</a> picked up the PyLadies baton the following day, with talks about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/audreyr/django-package-thunderdome-by-audrey-roy-daniel-greenfeld">Django packages</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/cosecant/best-practices-for-frontend-django-developers">Django for the Front-End</a>, respectively. <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/kjam">Katharine</a> spoke on Wednesday afternoon about <a class="reference external" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19508576/djangocon_slides/src/scraper_talk.html">web-scraping methods</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/djangocon/6146295356_b7fe674122_b.jpg" /></p>
<p>I'm singling out the PyLadies-driven sessions specially here, but of
course there were numerous other great technical talks on topics ranging
from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/idangazit/dc2011-keynote%20to%20security">design</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/idangazit">Idan Gazit</a>), to <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.us/schedule/presentations/52/">security
issues</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/paulrmcmillan">Paul
McMillan</a>), to pouring out some
good-natured haterade for&nbsp; our favorite framework and language (<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/glyph">Glyph
Lefkowitz's</a> memorable keynote was entitled:
&quot;Why does Django Hate Python&quot;?).</p>
<p>Most of us were heavily sleep-deprived by Friday -- thank heaven for
Stumptown Roasters and Voodoo Doughnuts! Still, inspired by <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/holdenweb">Steve
Holden</a>'s and <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/ubernostrum">James
Bennett</a>'s respective talks about
Django's <a class="reference external" href="http://t.co/E8VkaJM">documentation</a>, a few PyLadies
delegates got together with a number of other devs at <a class="reference external" href="http://urbanairship.com/">Urban
Airship</a> for code sprints, to try and rework
the official <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Tutorials">Django
tutorial</a> so that it
would be more friendly to beginners and casual Djangologists. <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/natea">Nate
Aune</a> started a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/natea/djangostarterkit">git
repo</a> for the project and
we hope to continue to plug away at it even though the conference is
over.&nbsp; Still, while coding remotely has its pros, it was pretty awesome
to be able to sit in the same room with dozens of talented folks to plug
away at the same open-source project!</p>

<h2>Off the program</h2>
<p>It wasn't all work for us, of course -- there was plenty of
extra-curricular fun to be had in Portland, from printing and selling
out our <a class="reference external" href="static/blog/djangsta-shirts-on-sale-at-djangocon">Djangsta shirts</a>
(conceived by Katharine and designed by Christine); to sneaking multiple
trips to Powell's Books and Portland's famous food carts (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.foodcartsportland.com/2009/05/22/whiffies-pie-cart/">deep fried
pie</a>
FTW!!); to hosting a <a class="reference external" href="static/blog/pyladies-meetup-at-djangocon">meetup</a> for
DjangoCon PyLadies/friends-of-PyLadies at McMeanamin's Pub on night 2 of
the conference. <a class="reference external" href="http://myemma.com">Emma Email Marketing</a> pitched in
for generous quantities of beer for us, and we are indebted to Portland
PyLady <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/pythonchelle">Michelle</a> for organizing this
hugely successful get-together!</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/djangocon/6145750461_21968427fa_b.jpg" /></p>
<p>The best part about the conference, of course, was meeting, coding, and
carousing with Django devs from all over the world, many of whom we'd
first conversed with online, via IRC or Twitter. There seemed to be a
fair amount of conference buzz circulating about the PyLadies even
before we arrived; what an odd feeling it was to have strangers
recognize me by my Twitter avatar -- not to mention how odd it felt to
introduce myself to others whom I'd recognized in the same manner!</p>

</div>
<p>Speaking of which: the background tweet-chatter and retweeting of points
from sessions we were missing out on was great to follow, sure, but
Twitter was also awesome for things like helping out PyLady
<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/geography76">Dana</a> when she was having some
trouble getting PostgreSQL running on her MacBook Pro, or for reserving
Djangsta shirts before they sold out.</p>
<p>Special props go to <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/shinjikim">Shinji</a> and Emily,
who used Twitter to reach out to us and find their way into the
conference after I tweeted a call for applicants. We're so excited that
people like them are taking the initiative to start PyLadies (or
similar) groups all over the country!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="help-from-our-friends">
<h2>Help from our friends</h2>
<p>Most of this would have been inconceivable without the incredible amount
of support we received from a few great people and their companies --
and all we had to do was
<a class="reference external" href="http://pyladies.com/blog/call-for-sponsorship/">ask!</a> You can read
the <a class="reference external" href="static/blog/djangocon-sponsorship-program-results">full report of the
results</a> of our
DjangoCon sponsorship program, but suffice it to say here that we were
overwhelmed by the response.</p>
<p>We also have to acknowledge the exceptional hospitality of the
conference organizers, including Steve, <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/theseanoc">Sean
O'Connor</a>, and Nancy Asche, who lavished
the PyLadies with care &amp; attention, using every possible opportunity to
demonstrate their commitment to seeing diversity flourish in the Python
community. It was especially awesome of them to have arranged the
weather in Portland to be unseasonably pleasant for us out-of-towners ;)</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

tips, or twenties (for the shirts!). It's really exciting to connect
with others who want to join us in our efforts to promote Python and
open source, and do their part to increase the overall diversity of our
community!</p>
<p>We plan to put the money we earned from the tutorials and T-shirt sales
toward establishing the PyLadies as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization so
that we can continue to do the things we've been doing for a long time
to come.</p>
<p>All in all, I left Portland feeling inspired by the openness,
intelligence, and big-heartedness of the Django community, and I know
I'm not the only one.</p>
