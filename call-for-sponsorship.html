        <p>PyLadies needs your help getting women to DjangoCon. &nbsp;There are women
who could really benefit from the experience.</p>
<div class="section" id="help-us-get-more-women-to-djangocon">
<h2>Help us get more women to DjangoCon</h2>
<p>What happens when you encourage a talented female Django developer to
attend DjangoCon and then give her a free ticket? &nbsp;First she gets really
excited:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5888664375/">|Why is &#64;estherbester going to
DjangoCon?|</a></p>
<p>Then she discovers a world of new opportunities. &nbsp;She gains the
confidence to start open-sourcing reusable Django apps. &nbsp;She contributes
to open-source Django projects, maybe even Django itself.</p>
<p>She proposes a talk the following year. &nbsp;PyLadies mentors her to help
get her talk accepted. &nbsp;She gets accepted and presents on one of her
open-source projects.</p>
<p>Her Django app turns out to be so useful that she gets asked to
integrate her project into Django core during the sprints ;)</p>
<p>I counted about 5 women at DjangoCon last year. &nbsp;Let's make this year
different. &nbsp;Let's aim to have 25 women. &nbsp;If there are 250 attendees,
that's 10% women.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-you-can-help">
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>1. Email audreyr {at} pyladies.com. &nbsp;Say &quot;I pledge to donate X amount to
helping women get to DjangoCon.&quot;</p>
<p>She'll use this info to let a woman know ASAP that she should get her
speaker proposal in before the deadline. &nbsp;Or to let a potential attendee
start making plans.</p>
<p>2. We'll send you an email with instructions about how to get the funds
to us (probably PayPal or check). Plus background info from me about the
woman whom you're sponsoring, so that you know that this is for real.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-we-decide-who-gets-to-go">
<h2>How we decide who gets to go</h2>
<p>Priority will be based on the following factors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Genuine financial need</li>
<li>Desire to speak at DjangoCon, combined with Django expertise and
speaking ability. &nbsp;Talented potential speakers get extra priority.</li>
<li>Contributions to open-source</li>
<li>Contributions to Python women's advocacy efforts</li>
<li>Desire to attend</li>
<li>Impact that attendance will have on her life, especially for
first-time attendees</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll receive:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an email report from us about the person you're sponsoring, and why
you made the right decision</li>
<li>a personal thank-you at DjangoCon from that person</li>
<li>your link listed on a page that we'll be putting up for sponsors</li>
<li>your logo displayed on that page, if you donate substantially more
than others (amount TBD) and/or better placement</li>
<li>a personal guarantee from me that the PyLadies and I will mentor the
person you sponsored. &nbsp;We will help them through their Django career
and put friendly pressure on them to contribute to open-source</li>
</ul>
<p>In cases of extreme financial need, we'll give the woman not just a
ticket but help with travel, lodging, and/or food.</p>
<p>If you're a woman reading this and could use assistance, email audreyr
{at} pyladies {dot} com. &nbsp;We'll do our best to help as many women as
possible.</p>
