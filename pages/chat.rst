#pyladies on FreeNode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our IRC channel, #pyladies on FreeNode, is open to all women of the
Python community of every experience level.  Men who are interested in
helping women get into Python development are also welcome.

Whether you have Python-related questions or just want to hang out and
meet others, drop in and say hi!  If no one answers, say the name of
someone in the channel or try back later.

New to IRC?  `Click here for instructions </chat/irc-instructions/>`_.

Discussion List (Google Group)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We also have a Google Group discussion list, open to all women of any
experience level with Python.  As with IRC channel #pyladies, men are
welcome too.  The only rule is that you try extra-hard to be positive
and encouraging.

subscribe to that one.
