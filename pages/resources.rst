Here's a list of useful resources for learning and using Python.  If you
have further questions, please come to the next PyLadies event and ask
any of the organizers for advice or help.  

We also go to all the Python user group meetups in the area (see below).
 You should come too -- it's a fun community!  Don't be shy about
bothering any of us for Python help at user groups.

Learning Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intro to Python tutorials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Learn Python The Hard Way
   `http://learnpythonthehardway.org <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/>`_
-  How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
   `http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/ <http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/>`_

User Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^

A great way to continue learning Python is to work on your own, then
attend presentations and ask questions at local user groups.  Attend as
many as you can!

-  PyLadies `http://pyladies.com/ <http://pyladies.com/>`_
-  SoCal Piggies
   `http://socal-piggies.org/scp <http://socal-piggies.org/scp>`_
-  LA Python
   `http://www.meetup.com/lapython/ <http://www.meetup.com/lapython/>`_
-  LA Django (see below)
   `http://www.meetup.com/ladjango/ <http://www.meetup.com/ladjango/>`_

Newsletters
^^^^^^^^^^^

Python Weekly is a free weekly newsletter all about Python (articles,
news, jobs, etc)
`http://www.pythonweekly.com <http://www.pythonweekly.com>`_

Tools
~~~~~

Text editors
^^^^^^^^^^^^

gEdit, Notepad++, Sublime.
More “advanced” editors are emacs, vim (although @audreyr knows how to
use both of those pretty well and still swears by gEdit for everything)

IDEs
^^^^

PyCharm, Eclipse with PyDev plugin, Wingware

Highly recommended Python package tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pip: better installation of packages
`http://www.pip-installer.org/ <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_
virtualenv: create isolated Python environments
`http://www.virtualenv.org <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_
virtualenvwrapper: make virtualenv easier to use
`http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/ <http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/>`_

Using Python to build web apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django
^^^^^^

One of the most popular web frameworks.
 `http://www.djangoproject.com/ <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
Official Django poll app tutorial: recommended if you don’t know where
to start with using Python for web programming.
`https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/tutorial01/ <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/tutorial01/>`_
Develop your web app locally and then deploy it onto a web server.  We
recommend one of the following Django hosting options:
DjangoZoom `http://djangozoom.com/ <http://djangozoom.com/>`_
Webfaction `http://www.webfaction.com/ <http://www.webfaction.com/>`_
Gondor.io `https://gondor.io/ <https://gondor.io/>`_
ep.io `http://www.ep.io/ <http://www.ep.io/>`_
Several of the PyLadies organizers use Django regularly and are members
of LA Django. Come to this meetup every month to learn more:

Other web frameworks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These have smaller communities but can also be interesting, depending on
your needs:
Pyramid (merger of Pylons and repoze.bfg)
`http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/dev/ <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/dev/>`_
Flask `http://flask.pocoo.org/ <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_
GAE
`http://code.google.com/appengine/ <http://code.google.com/appengine/>`_
Lots more options to choose from.  We’ll post a link to Katharine’s web
frameworks lightning talk here shortly.

Organizing your own women's Python workshops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Are you interested in doing a women's Python workshop of your own in
your city?  Email any of the organizers and we'll help you get the word
out.  We'll tweet, post blog entries, and do whatever we can to help.

We don't care what you call it, how you structure it, or whether you're
male or female.  Any effort you put into encouraging women to join the
Python community is something that we support.  

Our own materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The slides from our talks are all available from:

`http://www.pyladies.com/resources/slides-from-51511-beginners-workshop/ </resources/slides-from-51511-beginners-workshop/>`_ 

Other workshop materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are links to other women's Python workshops.  If you don't reach
out to us, reach out to them.

Community-building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Workshops are just one part of PyLadies' effort to increase the female
count in the Python world.  PyLadies is a community of female developers
who care about helping other women get into Python.

We plan to put together a package of materials to help you build your
own local women's Python community.  We'll be posting a "PyLadies Kit"
here soon.
