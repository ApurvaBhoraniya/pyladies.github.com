    <p>PyLadies supported 29 developers, with tickets and funds allocated as
follows:
We would especially like to thank the <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/psf">Python Software
Foundation</a>, who worked with us to coordinate
our financial program with theirs to maximize the amount of funding that
would go toward increasing the diversity of PyCon attendance.
<strong>Distribution of resources</strong>
11 tickets (Complimentary registrations)
$2900.00 Purchased registrations
$ 900.00 Reimbursement for tutorials
$2444.40 Travel funding
--------------------------
$6244.40 Total funds disbursed
100% of the monetary amount was offered to the 32 applicants who were
eligible to receive funding, 97% of which was accepted by 29 of the 32
applicants.
$206.60 remains of out of the money that was offered but not accepted,
and will be set aside as seed funding to be put toward next yearâ€™s
financial aid program.
Next year we hope to set aside more money to support at least one
international PyLady.
<strong>STATISTICS</strong>
In-state attendees: 14
Out-of-state: 13
International: 2
PyCon Speakers: 4
Poster Presenters: 4
Students: 7
<strong>First-time attendees: 23</strong> (I totally wanted to apply the &lt;blink&gt; tag
on this one)
<strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA</strong>
Applicants were given priority according to the following weighted
scale, based on information they provided on their applications,
submitted bio, email correspondence, and any other material available
(Github/Bitbucket/other online VCS accounts, blog posts, other
references).
<strong>Weight/Criterion</strong>
50% Speaking at PyCon - Speakers get top priority
20% Open source/advocacy - Contributions to open source or
diversity-advocacy
15% Financial need - Evidence of financial need
10% Potential life impact - Impact of attendance on career/
academic/life goals
&nbsp;5% Prior experience/ability - Technical background/skills
<strong>ONGOING MENTORSHIP</strong>
All women who receive a grant also receive a lifetime of peer mentorship
through the PyLadies community.</p>
<p>PyLadies encourages women to grow as leaders in the Python open-source
community, with mentoring for interested conference speakers and
opportunities for teaching and active discussion of Python programming
issues, in addition to contributing to open-source projects.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure</em>
Last September, a secret Python angel paid my entire way to DjangoCon,
making it the first tech conference I ever attended. It was an amazing
experience, one that led me to make a huge career switch, from
programming hobbyist to full-time web developer. I know firsthand the
impact that this kind of program can have, which is why it means so much
to me personally to see it succeed. Best of all, my own trip to PyCon
this year was fully paid for by my new employer =D&nbsp; Cheers! - Esther N.
