We are a group of women developers worldwide who love the Python programming language.  We write code by day or night.  Some of us hack on Python projects on the side, while others work full-time on Python development.  But it doesn't matter.  We all just like writing Python code, and that's what brings us together.

Please join us!
================
Are you an experienced female Python developer?  Or are you new and need help getting into Python development?  

Here's what to do:

1. Follow our RSS feed for events and gatherings.
2. Join us at events and gatherings, or organize your own local Pyladies chapter!

Developers Only
================
Developers and aspiring developers only, please!  There are some fantastic groups for women tech entrepreneurs/social media marketers out there, which some of us participate in as well, but let's keep this group primarily focused on Python programming.

Organization of PyLadies
========================

PyLadies is a chapter based organization, where women from each municipality around the world can begin their own group. Each group is literally a Python Users Group, and the Python Software Foundation, via the Outreach and Education Board, provides encouragement and base funding for things like web hosting.
