PyLadies' DjangoCon 2011 / PyCon 2012 Talk Proposal Brainstorming Session
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brunch at Corner Bakery (345 S Lake Ave Ste 107, Pasadena, CA 91101)
followed by collaboration time at the Loud3r office
June 25, 2011
11am until...whenever we've got a set of solid talk proposals

Prerequisite: enough familiarity with Django to actively participate in
brainstorming/constructing DjangoCon talk proposals. Absolute beginners
and non-developers beware!

Bring index cards with as many DjangoCon talk ideas as you can think of,
both for yourself and for others to consider using. At least 3 cards is
a good start.  Bonus points if you come up with 5 or more ideas.

Python Ladies' Night 4
----------------------

Immediately following the PyLadies Hack Session.  You're encouraged to
attend both events, but if you can't make it during the day, come for
Python Ladies' Night at least.

June 18, 2011 from 8pm onward
The Hollywood Canteen
1006 Seward St, Los Angeles, CA 90038 

All ladies of the Python community are invited to hang out with us for a
night of fun in Hollywood. We'll meet up at \ `The Hollywood
Canteen <http://www.hollywoodcanteenla.com/>`_ at 8pm, then possibly
visit other nearby bars afterward.  Significant others and friends
(including mentors from the earlier sprint) are welcome.

PyLadies Hackathon
------------------

Saturday June 18, 2011 from 2-8pm

`|Register for PyLadies Hackathon in Los Angeles, CA on
Eventbrite| <http://pyladies-hackathon.eventbrite.com?ref=ebtn>`_

Bring a laptop and code on your own projects.  If you need advice on how
to get started with a project idea, we'll help you get started and then
let you work independently.  

You can work on absolutely anything you want, private or open-source, as
long as it involves some Python code.  But thanks to a grant from the
PSF, we'll be giving you an extra incentive to get into open-source.  If
you contribute to an open-source project or even open-source some code
that you've written, you'll receive a free PyLadies t-shirt.

We're planning to have 1 mentor available for every 1-3 attendees.  If
you need Python help, consider this a session with your personal Python
trainer who's going to help you get coding!

The last hour will be for lightning talks.  Sign up to present on
something Python- or developer-related by emailing audreyr@pyladies.com
or any of the other organizers.
