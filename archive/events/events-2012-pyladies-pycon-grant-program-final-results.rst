PyLadies supported 29 developers, with tickets and funds allocated as
follows:

We would especially like to thank the `Python Software
Foundation <http://python.org/psf>`_, who worked with us to coordinate
our financial program with theirs to maximize the amount of funding that
would go toward increasing the diversity of PyCon attendance.


**Distribution of resources**::

    11 tickets (Complimentary registrations)
    $2900.00 Purchased registrations
    $ 900.00 Reimbursement for tutorials
    $2444.40 Travel funding
    --
    $6244.40 Total funds disbursed

100% of the monetary amount was offered to the 32 applicants who were
eligible to receive funding, 97% of which was accepted by 29 of the 32
applicants.

$206.60 remains of out of the money that was offered but not accepted,
and will be set aside as seed funding to be put toward next yearâ€™s
financial aid program.

Next year we hope to set aside more money to support at least one
international PyLady.

**ONGOING MENTORSHIP**

All women who receive a grant also receive a lifetime of peer mentorship
through the PyLadies community.

PyLadies encourages women to grow as leaders in the Python open-source
community, with mentoring for interested conference speakers and
opportunities for teaching and active discussion of Python programming
issues, in addition to contributing to open-source projects.

*Disclosure*

Last September, a secret Python angel paid my entire way to DjangoCon,
making it the first tech conference I ever attended. It was an amazing
experience, one that led me to make a huge career switch, from
programming hobbyist to full-time web developer. I know firsthand the
impact that this kind of program can have, which is why it means so much
to me personally to see it succeed. Best of all, my own trip to PyCon
this year was fully paid for by my new employer =D  Cheers! - Esther N.
