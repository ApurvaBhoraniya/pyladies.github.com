I am really excited to announce our second keynote speaker for DjangoCon
Europe 2012 - Jessica McKellar.

Jessica is a kernel engineer from Cambridge, Massachusetts. She's a
maintainer of several open source Python projects, most notably Twisted
and OpenHatch. She's also working on a new edition of Twisted Networking
Essentials for O'Reilly.

On top of her open source contributions, she is also a Python Software
Foundation board member and a crucial part in the Boston Python User
Group, the largest Python user group in the world. With that group she
runs the Boston Python Workshop, an introductory programming pipeline
that has brought hundreds of women into the local Python community and
is being replicated in cities across the US.
