The LA Weekly blog featured a few of the LA PyLadies in a `recent
post. <http://blogs.laweekly.com/arts/2012/02/pyladies_django_python.php>`_
The Open Hatchery highlights a nice example of the `power of community
collaboration <https://openhatch.org/blog/2012/diversifying-pycon-the-power-of-cooperative-outreach/>`_
and outreach (we can't wait to meet Pam at PyCon!)

We've even stirred a bit of discussion on
`Reddit <http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/psnr6/geek_chicks_pyladies_a_gang_of_female_computer/>`_
-- care to join the fray? =)
