On April 16, 2011, a group of 5 local female Python developers got
together for the first ever Python ladies' night.  

We had wine, sparkling elderflower and ginger waters, vegetable
spaghetti, savory meat pies from Porto's bakery, Caesar salad, homemade
garlic bread, tea, and tiramisu. 

We talked about:

-  Python women's advocacy (mostly!)
-  virtualenv
-  the mod\_wsgi documentation
-  Django-based content management systems
-  how we each got into Python development

And we started plans for a women's Python workshop on May 15, 2011.
 Details about how to get tickets will be announced this week.

It was an exciting meeting with a lot of positive energy.  Everyone
present was passionate about Python women's advocacy and wanted to help
increase diversity in the local Python community.  

At the end, we went up to the rooftop lounge, where we had a spectacular
view of downtown LA.  Some of us relaxed in the jacuzzi, while others
hung out and chatted poolside.

Our next ladies' night is scheduled for May 6, 2011.  If you'd like to
come and get involved, please contact me at audreyr@cartwheelweb.com for
