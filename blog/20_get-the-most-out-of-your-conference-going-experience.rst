As seen in our last newsletter: @\ `kjam <http://twitter.com/kjam>`_
and @\ `sandymahalo <http://twitter.com/sandymahalo>`_ are pro
conference attendees (and speakers!). Here they present advice for those
who may be new to the world of tech conferences and other
neck-beard-laden gatherings like
`SCALE10x <http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/>`_, which is happening this
entire weekend in Los Angeles.

1. **Don't be intimidated by intense topics or talks.** Part of
attending a conference is exposing yourself to new content and learning
from it. If you don't get it all, you may be reminded of it years later
when you come across something similar.

2.\ **It's okay to walk out.** If you aren't sure about a talk, it's
\*totally\* okay to sit in the back and dip out if it's not what you
expected or if you don't feel like it's going to be interesting or
helpful to you.

3. **Do talk to people.** One of the best things about conferences is
meeting folks you enjoy or who challenge and inspire you. Don't fill
your entire calendar with talks, spend some of the time just chatting
with folks who are there and making new friends.
