`As previously mentioned </blog/pyladies-at-pycon-2012/>`_, the PyLadies
are working with the PSF to ensure that PyLadies who want to attend
`PyCon 2012 <http://us.pycon.org/2012>`_ can do so.  To that end, we are
accepting `applications for grants to attend
PyCon <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEtUbUZxZWN6V3FGdkVydEtvU2ZwMUE6MQ>`_
in Santa Clara, CA from March 7-15.

Let's make PyCon as diverse as the Python Community as a whole -- if not
more! Many thanks to the PSF for partnering with us on this initiative.

**Attendees**: If you are a female Python developer who wants to attend
but needs financial assistance in order to do so, please `fill out this
form <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEtUbUZxZWN6V3FGdkVydEtvU2ZwMUE6MQ>`_
as soon as possible.

The application period for this year has ended. If you have not received
a reply from us about the status of your application, please email
esther @ pyladies com immediately.

**Sponsors**: If you are interested in providing financial assistance to
a budding Python developer in need, please contact esther @ pyladies.com

`We did something similar this past year for
DjangoCon </blog/djangocon-sponsorship-program-results/>`_, and plan to
continue this program for as long as we can sustain it. If you can help
us, you will helping to change the community, and maybe even a couple of
lives!

How grant recipients will be chosen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Priority will be based on the following factors:

-  Genuine financial need
-  Talk proposal acceptance (those invited to speak at PyCon will have
   higher priority)
-  Level of experience in programming
-  Contributions to open-source
-  Contributions to Python diversity advocacy efforts
-  Desire to attend
-  Impact that attendance will have on her life, especially for
   first-time attendees 

Sponsors will receive:

-  an email report from us about the person you're sponsoring, and why
   you made the right decision
-  your link listed on a page that we'll be putting up for sponsors
-  your logo displayed on that page, if you donate substantially more
   than others (amount TBD) and/or better placement
-  a personal guarantee from me that the PyLadies and I will mentor the
   person you sponsored.  We will help them through their Python career
   and put friendly pressure on them to contribute to open-source =)
